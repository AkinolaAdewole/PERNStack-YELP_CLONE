morgan is a popular middleware for Node.js and Express.js that provides HTTP request logging functionality. It automatically logs 
incoming HTTP requests and their details to the console or to a log file. This makes it useful for monitoring and debugging purposes, 
as it helps you track incoming requests and understand what's happening in your application.

To use morgan, you first need to install it in your Node.js project:

npm install morgan


Once installed, you can use it in your Express.js application like this:

const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const app = express();

// Use morgan middleware to log HTTP requests to the console
app.use(morgan('dev'));

// Your other routes and middleware would go here

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
